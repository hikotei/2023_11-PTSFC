# train test split

# fit ARIMA models
# fit ARIMA + GARCH models

# save models in dict: model params + in sample fcasts
# evaluate models on test set using rolling window fcast

# create results df with:

    # model params ie p, q, arch_p, arch_q
    # model information criteria
    # model log likelihood
    # in sample errors: MSE, MAE, MAPE, SMAPE
    # out of sample fcast errors: MSE, MAE, MAPE, SMAPE
